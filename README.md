# Blockchain Introductory Course Lab

Welcome to the Blockchain Introductory Course Lab! This project serves as a lab framework to help students understand blockchain technology and its related concepts through hands-on coding. The project consists of three labs, each with specific tasks and incomplete code sections that students need to complete following the lab instructions.


### Labs Overview

#### Lab-1: SHA-256 Cryptographic Algorithm

The Lab-1 folder contains a file named sha256.py, which involves the implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm. In this file, the key parts are left incomplete, indicated by TODOs. Participating students need to complete the missing code and ensure that sha256.py runs correctly.

#### Lab-2: Blockchain and PoW Consensus Algorithm

The Lab-2 folder contains two files: block.py and pow.py. In block.py, the data structures for blocks and blockchains, along with necessary methods, are implemented. However, some key content remains incomplete, and students participating in the lab need to finish this code.

In pow.py, the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm is implemented. In this program, three threads compete to mine five blocks using the PoW algorithm, but the crucial part of the PoW consensus algorithm is yet to be completed. Students need to fill in this part of the code, run pow.py, and verify the correctness of the current blockchain.

#### Lab-3: Simple Voting Smart Contract

The Lab-3 folder contains a file named vote.sol, which implements a basic voting smart contract using the Solidity language. However, some functions in the contract are not yet completed. Participating students need to implement these functions to make the contract fully functional.


### Participate

1. Fork this project to your own Git repository.
2. Clone the Forked project to your local machine using Git.
3. In each Lab folder, find the code sections marked with TODOs, and complete the corresponding tasks according to the lab instructions.
4. After completing the tasks in each lab, you can run the respective code for validation. Please ensure that the code runs correctly and passes the validation.


### Guidelines

+ Please conduct the labs under the guidance of the course instructions to understand each task's requirements thoroughly.
+ Respect academic integrity and avoid plagiarism of other people's code.
+ Your feedback and suggestions are welcome to help us improve and refine this lab framework.
